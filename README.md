# ABOUT ME


I am a graduate student at the University of Florida, currently working on my Ph.D. in Statistics. My academic advisor is Dr. Michael J. Daniels.
I also work as Dr. Daniels' research assistant.


## Research
My primary research interests lie in Bayesian semi/non parametric modeling, causal inference, joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data, 
and missing data methodology. I am also interested in the applications of Statistics in public health and medicine.
